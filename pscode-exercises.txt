// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Enter a num
if (numb % 2) remainder is 0;
	then the num is even
else
	the num is odd;

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter 5 num
	(sum of 5 nums)/5 = avg;
	num.sort()
print ("Minimum number form the list is: " [0])
print ("Maximum number form the list is: " [4])
